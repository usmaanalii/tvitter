#### Task

**Create a twitter like social media platform for sharing tv/movie interests**

#### Basic Features

You are tasked with developing a prototype system in **PHP** and **JavaScript** with a back-end
database (e.g. **MySQL**), to store details of registered posters, posted TV episodes and
comments. For the prototype you can make the following simplifying assumptions:

1. A reader can view all posts of all users.

2. Each user has a page that lists all of the TV episodes and comments that they have
posted.

3. Any user can create an account and immediately create posts.

4. Once registered, a user can edit their own profile that contains a short biography and their contact details.

5. All posts are to be time stamped with their creation date and time.

6. Both interfaces (mobile and desktop) have the same functionality and display the same content but in a manner appropriate to each device.

##### You also need to provide the following functionality:

1. A post should contain the TV episode name and series/TV programme it is a part of and a comment of up to 140 characters including spaces.

2. Posters can delete their own past posts.

3. Posters can create and edit their own profile.

4. Any user can see a list of all messages for any poster ordered by date posted (most recent first).

5. Any user can view the profile of any poster.

6. Validation of all data entry forms.

7. A secure login system for posters.

8. A registration system for any user to become a poster.

#### Advanced Features

In addition to the basic functionality, you will get additional marks if the prototype provides
the following functionality:

1. Posters should be able to “tag” the TV episode they are posting with a suitable tag e.g.actors, genre, year etc., and users should be able to view all posts that have been posted with a particular tag e.g. view all posts that have been tagged with “2017”.

2. A user’s profile page should contain their short biography/contact details as well as a list of their posts.

3. jQuery validators and Ajax functions that check the password strength and username availability within the registration form (whilst the user is typing).
